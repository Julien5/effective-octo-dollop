What happened ?

I wanted to use sdk_system_deep_sleep_set_option, but it's not implemented:
  https://github.com/SuperHouse/esp-open-rtos/issues/200

So I tried to switch to Espressif toolkit.
But the current release (v3.x) is not well documented.
I could not find rtc memory read/write API.
I suspect it is not implemented yet.

So I had to downgrade to v2.x.
But then I cannot get any ...

ha.
